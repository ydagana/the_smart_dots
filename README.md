# the_smart_dots
The smart dots - a c++ game with SDL

## Game goal:
- You can either play against a friend or against the CPU. Use arrows to move between choices.
- Each player gets their turn to play (place a dot on the grid).
- To win a set you need to finish a range of 5 consecutive dots (either horizentally, vertically or diagonally) before your opponent.
- The game consists of 5 sets, the winner of 3 sets wins the game (just like a tennis grand-slam game :D).
- You can't place a dot on top of an existing dor, or undo placing a dot.

Enjoy
